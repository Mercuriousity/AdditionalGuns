In order to keep both the project and pull requests clean there are some guidelines contributors need to be aware of.

### General guidelines
* Create a <ins>**seperate branch**</ins> for <ins>**every Pull Request**</ins>. This way you can keep your branch(es) up-to-date with the branch(es) from Additional Guns.
* A new Pull Request **must always** target the [**main**](https://github.com/Mr-Pineapple/AdditionalGuns/tree/main) branch **first**!
After your PR has been merged you may backport it to an older version if you wish and/or the version is still supported by the Additional Guns developers.
* Please make use of a *version control system* if you are contributing large quantities of code. (e.g. [Git](https://git-scm.com))

### Additional guidelines for model contributers
* Avoid using illegal character in file names. (e.g. spaces, ``*`` etc.) ``_`` and ``-`` are fine however.
* Try to optimize your model. Don't make it too big.
* Contributing just models and textures is enough.
The team can take care of everything else, considering enough information is provided with the contribution. (Think about what the desired gun properties/stats/data, crafting ingredients etc. will look like)
  * Providing your own gun data is also allowed, but is not required.
  * There's no need to touch any of the mods code, the team prefers to do it themselves.
