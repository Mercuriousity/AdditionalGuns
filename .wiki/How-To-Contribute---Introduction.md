### 🔨 How To Contribute to Additional Guns
**Additional Guns** is a mod created by the community. And **you** can contribute too! \
All contributions are done through GitHub, so a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) is **required**.

### 🍴 Creating a Fork
You can't contribute directly into the Additional Guns repository unless you have write-access.
That's why you need to create a fork first.
Read more about [forking a repository here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)!

### ✏️ Commiting to your own Fork
Before you make your first commit, *please* create a seperate branch **first!**
This way you can keep the **main** branch up-to-date with the latest changes from the Additional Guns repository.
It would be best to create a new branch **for every Pull Request you make**.

> Read more about creating a **new branch** [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)!

### 📜 Creating a Pull Request
In order to get your commits added to the Additional Guns repository you'll need to create a [new Pull Request](https://github.com/Mr-Pineapple/AdditionalGuns/compare) first.
Please make sure to add as much information to your Pull Request description as possible.
Before creating your pull request, please read the [project's pull request guidelines](./Pull-Request-Guidelines) **first**!

Your Pull Request will be reviewed as soon as possible, and you might get asked to make some additional changes before it gets merged.
